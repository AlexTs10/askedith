Sorry, an error occurred :(

Status 60001:

scope_not_allowed

Scope 'email.read_only' not allowed for provider 'google'
"""

Nylas explanation:
'''
This error occurs because the scope 'email.read_only' is not a valid scope for Google authentication with Nylas. For Google, you need to use the correct Google-specific scopes1. Here are the valid read-only scopes for Google:

    https://www.googleapis.com/auth/gmail.readonly - View messages
    https://www.googleapis.com/auth/calendar.readonly - View calendars and events
    https://www.googleapis.com/auth/calendar.events.readonly - View events on all calendars

When this type of scope error occurs, it returns a common.scope_not_allowed error type with a 400 status code indicating "One or more provided scopes is not allowed"2.

To resolve this, you'll need to re-authenticate using the correct Google scopes for your needs.

To re-authenticate with the correct Google scopes:

    First, identify which scopes you need based on what API endpoints you plan to use 1

    For Google authentication, you'll need to create a Google connector that includes your Google Cloud Platform (GCP) client_id and client_secret, and specify the default scopes you need 2

    When making the authentication request:
        Use the Bearer auth request header with your Nylas application's API key
        Set provider_type: "google"
        Include any non-default scopes you need

    For email access specifically, here are the minimum required Google scopes:
        For read-only access: /gmail.readonly 1
        For modifying messages: /gmail.modify
        For sending emails: /gmail.send

The scopes must match exactly or be a subset of the scopes configured in your Google Cloud Platform app 

I recommend checking the Authentication scopes documentation for a complete list of scopes based on which specific Nylas APIs you need to use 1
