Getting started with the SendGrid API

There are several ways you can get started with the SendGrid API.
Prerequisites for sending your first email with the SendGrid API
These instructions describe how to send your first email using cURL calls. This is one of many ways to send email with the SendGrid API - we also have PHP, Python, Node.js, Java, C#, Go, and Ruby

libraries.

Before you can start using the API, you need to do the following:

    Create a SendGrid account

.
Create an API Key
.
Make sure you have curl

    installed on your machine.

Info
cURL comes standard on Mac operating systems.
How to send an API email
Build your API call

Your API call must have the following components:

    A host. The host for Web API v3 requests is always https://api.sendgrid.com/v3/
    An Authorization header. An API Key

    must be included in the Authorization header.
    A request. When submitting data to a resource via POST or PUT, you must submit your payload in JSON.

(information)
Message size limit

The total message size should not exceed 20MB. This includes the message itself, headers, and the combined size of any attachments.
(information)
Setting Server Host

SendGrid recommends setting your server host to https://api.sendgrid.com/v3/ and not directly pointing to SendGrid IP addresses. SendGrid IP addresses occasionally change without notice and hardcoding IP addresses, especially without a way to regularly check for updates, can cause integrations to break.

Info

Basic Authentication is no longer accepted; you must use an API key.

To Send an email using the SendGrid API:

curl --request POST \

--url https://api.sendgrid.com/v3/mail/send \

--header 'Authorization: Bearer <<YOUR_API_KEY>>' \

--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \

--data '{"personalizations":[{"to":[{"email":"john.doe@example.com","name":"John Doe"}],"subject":"Hello, World!"}],"content": [{"type": "text/plain", "value": "Heya!"}],"from":{"email":"sam.smith@example.com","name":"Sam Smith"},"reply_to":{"email":"sam.smith@example.com","name":"Sam Smith"}}'

    Copy the curl example above.
    Paste the curl call into your favorite text editor.
    Copy your API key and paste it in the "Authorization" header.
    In the data section, specify the "to", "from", and "reply to" names and email addresses and enter a subject.
    Copy the code and paste it in your terminal.
    Hit Enter.
    Check the inbox of the address you specified as the "to" email and see your message!
